# ClassAvailabilityChecker
Tired of having to scour your school's website to see if a spot has opened up in a class? This simple python script will do it for you! Simply enter the URL of the course, the name of the HTML class  storing the amount of spots open, and get an email notifying you whenever that element changes. This will require you to have an account with smtp2go.com, which is completely free for up to 1,000 emails. You can change the find_all() selector to find() according to your needs, as well as the if statement. Overall, the entire script should be fairly intutive to use, but feel free to reach out with any questions -> nungchucks@gmail.com
